I am a Telecommunications Systems Engineer with a deep passion for the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Computer Vision**, and **Cybersecurity**. I specialize in building and deploying end-to-end machine learning systems to solve real-world challenges.

My work involves everything from foundational computer vision techniques like SIFT to modern deep learning architectures and state-of-the-art LLMs. I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in Germany to apply my skills to cutting-edge research.

### 🔭 My Core Competencies:
-   **Deep Learning & Computer Vision:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pattern Recognition, Transfer Learning, Image Segmentation.
-   **Modern AI & LLMs:** Gemini, Gemma, RAG Pipelines, LoRA/QLoRA Fine-Tuning, LangChain, CrewAI.
-   **Programming & Tools:** Python (NumPy, Pandas), MATLAB, C++, Git, GitHub, Linux.

### 🌱 What I'm currently working on:
Right now, I'm focused on documenting my Master's thesis projects and exploring efficient deep learning models. I'm always looking for new challenges in multimodal AI and robust biometric systems.
